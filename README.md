# AI Projects with OpenCV and Mediapipe

Welcome to my repository dedicated to various AI projects utilizing OpenCV and Mediapipe! This repository includes code for face detection, hand pose detection, object detection using HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space, and many more.

I have followed the YouTube lecture series "Artificial Intelligence for Everyone: An Introduction to AI for Absolute Beginners" by Paul McWhorter, which you can find [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGs0VKk2DiYyXlbJVaE8y1qr24YldYNDm&feature=shared).

## Introduction

This repository showcases a collection of AI projects that leverage the power of OpenCV and Mediapipe. The projects range from basic object detection using color spaces to more advanced techniques such as face and hand pose detection. Each project is well-documented and includes example images for better understanding.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Detect faces in images and video streams using OpenCV and Mediapipe.
- **Hand Pose Detection**: Track and detect hand landmarks using Mediapipe.
- **Object Detection using HSV**: Detect objects based on color using HSV color space in OpenCV.
- **Additional Projects**: Various other AI projects demonstrating the use of OpenCV and Mediapipe.
